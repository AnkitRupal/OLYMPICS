    <h2 style="text-align: center; font-size: 48px; margin-top: 48px;">PARALYMPICS - A SPORT OF SPECIALLY ABLED</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.5rem;" class="my-4">
        Paralympic Games or Paralympics is an international multi-sport event for athletes with a range of disabilities.
        The event usually takes place every two years and almost immediately after the Olympic Games. There are two
        versions of Paralympic games — Winter and Summer Games. All Paralympic Games are managed by the International
        Paralympic Committee (IPC). Athletes who participate have a range of disabilities including impaired muscle
        power, hypertonia, ataxia, vision impairment, intellectual impairment, etc.
    </p>

        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Paralympic Games Classification </h2>

        <p>Classification provides a structure for Paralympic competition. Athletes competing in Para sports have an
            impairment that leads to a competitive disadvantage. Consequently, a system has been put in place to
            minimise the impact of impairments on sport performance and to ensure the success of an athlete is
            determined by skill, fitness, power, endurance, tactical ability and mental focus. This system is called
            classification.

            Classification determines who is eligible to compete in a Para sport and it groups the eligible athletes in
            sport classes according to their activity limitation in a certain sport.

            The Paralympic Movement offers sport opportunities for athletes with physical, vision and/or intellectual
            impairments that have at least one of the following 10 eligible impairments: Impaired muscle power, Impaired
            passive range of movement, Limb deficiency, Leg length difference, Short stature, Muscle tension,
            Uncoordinated movement, Involuntary movements, Vision impairment, Intellectual Impairment.

            Classification systems differ by sport and are developed by the International Federations (IF) governing the
            sport. The IF is also responsible to review the system from time to time. See below the classification
            system which will be used for the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games.</p>

                        The current classification for Wheelchair Rugby is organised as follows:

                        Every Wheelchair Rugby player is assigned a point value based on their functional ability, from
                        0.5 for a player with the least physical function through to 3.5 for the most physical function.
                        A squad comprises of a maximum of 12 players and, during play, the total on-court value for each
                        team of four cannot exceed eight points. Teams fielding female players also receive an
                        additional 0.5 point allowance for each. This unique system means that players with minor
                        impairments (high-pointers) can compete alongside those with more serious impairments</p>
