            India first participated at the Olympic Games in 1900, with a lone athlete Norman Pritchard winning two medals – both silver – in athletics and became the first Asian nation to win an Olympic medal.
            The nation first sent a team to the Summer Olympic Games in 1920 and has participated in every Summer Games since then. India has also competed at several Winter Olympic Games beginning in 1964.
            </br>
            Indian athletes have won 35 medals, all at the Summer Games. For a period of time, Indian Men's Field Hockey Team was dominant in Olympic competition, winning eleven medals in twelve Olympics between 1928 and 1980. The run included eight gold medals of which six were won consecutively from 1928 to 1956.
            </br>
            From 1948 onwards, because of the IOA's wider outreach, India began sending delegations of over 50 athletes in several sports, each selected by its sports federation, to the Summer Olympics. The delegation was headed by a chef-de-mission. The Indian field hockey team won a gold medal at the 1948 Summer Olympics by defeating Great Britain in the final. It was the first gold medal for India as an independent nation.
            </br>
            In the 1952 Summer Olympics wrestler K. D. Jadhav won the first individual medal for independent India. The Indian field hockey team continued their dominance by winning a sixth straight title by defeating Pakistan in the final in 1956 Summer Olympics. The six straight title win by the Indian team was an Olympic record at that time. This record was later only surpassed by United States men's and women's basketball team.
            </br>
            In the 1960 Summer Olympics the hockey team lost the final and had to settle for silver medal. The team bounced back by winning gold at the 1964 Summer Olympics. But went on to win only bronze medals in the next two Olympics. In 1976 Summer Olympics India went home empty handed, the first time since 1924.
            </br>
            Indian hockey team won their record 8th olympic gold at the 1980 Summer Olympics.[16][17] India had to return empty handed in the next three Summer Olympics. At the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta, tennis player Leander Paes won a bronze medal at the men's singles event ending a barren run of 16 years without a medal at the Olympics and also became the first individual medalist since 1952.
