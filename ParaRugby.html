        <h1>Wheelchair Rugby</h1>
        <p>Wheelchair rugby was first contested at the Summer Paralympics as a demonstration sport in 1996. It became an
            official medal-awarding sport in 2000 and has been competed at every Summer Paralympics since then. Only one
            event, mixed team, is held.
            Four nations - United States, Canada, Australia and Great Britain have appeared in every wheelchair rugby
            Paralympic tournament since its introduction. The 1996 tournament was considered a demonstration event, but
            unlike the Olympics, medals were awarded and counted in the main medals table.

                        <li><b>Sport class 0.5 </b><br>Players have significantly limited function in their shoulder,
                            arms and hands, for example due to tetraplegia. The player would typically catch the ball by
                            tapping it into their lap and throwing the ball with a scoop pass. Their main role on the
                            court is as a blocker.</li>
                        <li><b>Sport class 1.5 </b><br>A player has fair arm function, which makes him or her an
                            excellent blocker. A 1.5 player will also handle the ball on occasion, but typically they
                            show some instability in the wrist, which leads to limited ball security. </li>
                        <li><b>Sport class 2.5 </b><br>Players in this sport class have good shoulder stability and arm
                            function. They might have some trunk control. Due to their ability to flex their fingers,
                            they can perform overhead passes, catch the ball with two hands and maneuver the wheelchair
                            effectively. In the team they are ball handlers and fairly fast playmakers.</li>

        Originally known as murderball, and called quad rugby in the United States, wheelchair rugby incorporates
        aspects of able-bodied rugby, alongside elements of basketball and handball. The sports men and women use manual
        wheelchairs to get around the hardwood court, and men and women compete together on the same teams.

        The aim of wheelchair rugby is for players to carry the ball across the line of their opponents, using brute
        force when necessary! Wheelchair rugby players also use their wheelchairs to block opposing players and prevent
        them from scoring, however, physical contact between players is not allowed. Anybody who has ever watched a game
        will find their perceptions of disabled people challenged; this is a rough and tough sport and there’s no time
        for playing gently!

        Wheelchair rugby is now a Paralympic sport, but was first invented in Canada in 1977, as a way of getting
        quadriplegic athletes involved in sport. It spread from Canada to the US, and is now an international sport
        played in 26 countries.
