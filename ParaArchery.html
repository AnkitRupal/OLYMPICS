        <h1>ParaArchery</h1>
        <p>The rules for targets, competition format and matchplay are the same as for the target archery and indoor
            archery disciplines. In addition to the recurve and compound categories, para archery also has a W1 category
            for athletes with a severe impairment and a visually impaired category.

            Para archers often use assistive devices, such as custom draw or release aids, mouth tabs or wheelchairs, to
            level the playing field. Classified athletes may also compete with able-bodied athletes in target archery
            events using their assistive devices.

            Archery is rooted in the history of the Paralympic movement and has featured on the programme of every
            Paralympic Games since the first edition in 1960.

            World Archery organises a para archery world championships, which is called the World Archery Para
            Championships, every two years. It was first held by the International Paralympic Committee in 1998 and
            ownership was transferred to World Archery in 2009.</p>

                        <li>Any athlete wishing to participate in Para sport competition must have an Underlying Health
                            Condition that leads to a permanent Eligible Impairment.The Paralympic Movement offers sport
                            opportunities for athletes that have an impairment that belongs to one of ten Eligible
                            Impairment types. </li>
                        <li> Each sport’s classification rules describe how severe an Eligible Impairment must be for an
                            athlete to be considered eligible to compete. These criteria are referred to as Minimum
                            Impairment Criteria. Minimum Impairment Criteria must ensure that an athlete’s Eligible
                            Impairment affects the extent to which the athlete is able to execute the specific tasks and
                            activities fundamental to the sport. </li>
                        <li> After an athlete has been designated as eligible for a sport, the classification panel will
                            assess which Sport Class the athlete will compete in. There are some sports that only have
                            one Sport Class (e.g. Para ice hockey or Para powerlifting). On the other hand, due to the
                            different disciplines (running, jumping, throwing events) and because the sport includes
                            athletes of all 10 Eligible Impairments, Para athletics have over 50 Sport Classes. </li>
                    </ul>

        <p>The classification for this sport was created during the 1940s and for much of its early history was a
            medical condition based classification system. In 1964, the International Sport Organization for the
            Disabled (ISOD) was created. They created the first formal classification system, which had 27. This was
            reduced to 12 classifications for the 1976 Summer Paralympics and was further reduced to nine
            classifications for the 1992 Summer Paralympics. In 1983, classification for cerebral palsy competitors
            in this sport was undertaken by the Cerebral Palsy-International Sports and Recreation Association
            (CP-ISRA). The classification was based upon the system designed for field athletics events. There
            were five cerebral palsy classifications for its competitors. Class 1 and Class 2 competitors could
            compete in the division 1, class 1 and class 2 events. They defined cerebral palsy as a
            non-progressive brain lesion that results in impairment. People with cerebral palsy or non-progressive brain
            damage were eligible for classification by them. </p>
